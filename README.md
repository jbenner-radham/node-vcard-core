vcard.js
========
[![CI Status][BUILD BADGE]][BUILD PAGE]

A suite for working with [vCards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard).

Heads Up!
---------
This repository has been deprecated and all current work on this project is now taking place [here](https://github.com/vcardjs). The monorepo paradigm just wasn't working for how I wanted to do things so now everything is centralized under a GitHub organization with multiple repos.

~~This is still very much a WIP project and is _**not**_ feature complete.~~

~~Currently only vCard 4.0 is supported but support for other versions is planned for the future.
vCard generation is complete, work is currently being done on parsing.~~

Testing
-------
```sh
npm test
```

Building
--------
```sh
npm run build
```

Cleaning Build Artifacts
------------------------
```sh
npm run clean
```
